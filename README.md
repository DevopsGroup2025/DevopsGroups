# Containerized Multi-Service Web Application with Reverse Proxy and Persistent Database

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the design and deployment of a **containerized multi-service web application** using **Docker** and **Docker Compose**. The system follows production-style infrastructure practices and focuses on **service orchestration, networking, security, and persistence**, rather than application feature complexity.

The application stack consists of:
- A backend API service
- A relational database with persistent storage
- A reverse proxy for routing and traffic management
- Isolated container networks and environment-based configuration
